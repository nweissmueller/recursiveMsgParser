# recursiveMsgParser

This project provides functionality to recursively parse a continuous string, 
constructed entirely of alphabet lower case characters, and without space delimiters, 
into all possible combinations of valid English words.

Solution 1: Recursive backtracking and pass by reference.
Solution 2: Recursive backtracking and pass by value.

The project was to develop a simple exercise for future CS106B students to hone their
understanding of three key CS concepts: recursive backtracking, pass by reference, and pass by value.
